        Lynch is also a painter, singer-songwriter, and avid practitioner of and
        advocate for transcendental meditation. His work is lush, dark, and
        often shot through with violence. Describing his creative process, he
        once said:
        <em>
          “I used to go to well-lit diners, because in a well-lit diner I could
          sit and think and daydream and I could go to dark places knowing that
          I could surface in a well-lit, safe place.”

    <h3>Biography:</h3>

    <p>  
      Considered among the top living American filmmakers, David Lynch is revered for his singular, mind-bending vision of reality that both entrances and disturbs viewers. <br><br> 
      
      Among his best-known feature-length films are:
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eraserhead"><em>Eraserhead (1977)</em></a>; 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elephant_Man_(film)"><em>The Elephant Man (1980)</em></a>
        , a critical and commercial success that launched his career; and 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Velvet_(film)"><em>Blue Velvet (1986)</em></a>. 
        His famed television series, the surrealistic murder mystery 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_Peaks"><em>Twin Peaks (1990–91)</em></a>
        , has been credited with redefining the possibilities of the medium. 
        <br><br>
        Lynch is also a painter, singer-songwriter, and avid practitioner of and advocate for transcendental meditation. His work is lush, dark, and often shot through with violence. Describing his creative process, he once said: <em>“I used to go to well-lit diners, because in a well-lit diner I could sit and think and daydream and I could go to dark places knowing that I could surface in a well-lit, safe place.”</em>
